# Code of Conduct for Pulsar-Stellar

## Our Galactic Oath

In the spirit of fostering an out-of-this-world community, we as contributors, maintainers, and aspiring space cadets, pledge to make participating in our project an alien-abduction-free experience for everyone, regardless of their planet of origin, galaxy, or whether they prefer coffee or tea.

## The Universal Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a supernova of positivity:

- Using language that is as inclusive as a black hole (but in a good way).
- Being respectful of differing opinions, even if they believe Pluto is still a planet.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism, even if it's delivered by an extraterrestrial.
- Focusing on what is best for the mission to uncharted galaxies.
- Showing empathy towards other space travelers, even when their spaceship is parked awkwardly.

Examples of behavior that might get you sucked into a wormhole:

- Using galaxy-gendered language or imagery, and unwelcome cosmic attention or advances.
- Trolling with your spaceship, insulting/derogatory comments, and launching personal or political photon torpedoes.
- Space piracy or any form of space harassment.
- Publishing your fellow astronaut's private coordinates without a galactic permit.
- Other conduct deemed inappropriate by the Intergalactic Council.

## Our Starfleet Responsibilities

Project captains (also known as maintainers) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable space travel behavior. They have the right to jettison cargo (comments, commits, code) that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any astronaut exhibiting behavior not befitting a space explorer.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces, and also when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples include using an official project communicator, posting via an official social media warp drive, or acting as an appointed ambassador at a space conference.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise space-law-breaking behavior may be reported by opening a communication channel with the project team at [your-email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed by our interstellar council and will result in a response that is deemed necessary for the harmony of the galaxy.

Project captains who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face diplomatic discussions with the Intergalactic Council.
